# Git-Setup
Setup information for GIT

A repository is a directory
Fork: a copy of a directory
Branch: a local copy of a directory where you will do your work

The original repository will be refered to as upstream when you view it from the fork point perspective.
The master branch can also be refered to as upstream in comparison to a created branch.

Install Git on windows: git-scm.com/

Fork a project and add an upstream link to the original repository: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

Update the fork from the upstream link: https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/
